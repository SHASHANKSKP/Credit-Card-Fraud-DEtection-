# Credit-Card-Fraud-DEtection-
Using a dataset of credit card transactions and multiple unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud.
Throughout the financial sector, machine learning
algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions.
That is exactly what we are going to be doing as
well. Using a dataset of credit card transactions and multiple
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, we are going to
identify transactions with a high probability of being credit
card fraud.The sub-aim is to present, compare and analyze
two anomaly detection algorithms Local Outlier Factor and
Isolation Forest algorithm.Furthermore, using metrics such as
precision, recall, and F1-scores, we will investigate why the
classification accuracy for these algorithms can be misleading.
